3.Artist Statement 
Ezekiel Althea De Guzman (b. 2001) is a Filipino-Chinese multi-disciplinary artist based in Cape Town, specialising primarily in digital painting and game design. She is currently completing her Bachelor’s degree in Visual Multimedia Arts at UNISA.

Ezekiel’s works are a deeply personal and emotional exploration of the artist experience, delving into themes of loneliness, artistic doubt, longing and creative paralysis. Drawing upon her cultural heritage, she integrates Asian aesthetics and music with narrative elements, conjuring a dreamlike atmosphere that reflects her inner turmoil and current mental state. 

In the realm of art, Ezekiel discovers solace and liberation, allowing her to confront and transcend the emotions she's long held inside. As the boundaries between self and art dissolve, she seeks to highlight the intersections of vulnerability of raw emotion as well as the resilience of the creative human spirit.
