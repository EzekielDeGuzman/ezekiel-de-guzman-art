This can go to the pencil ones:

"Losing" is a four-piece collection that delves into the darker corners of my emotional landscape. The deliberate choice of graphite as a medium signifies my eluctance to abandon my perfectionistic tendencies, a trait that surfaces in my inclination towards realism when drawing â€“ a style that demands precision and control.

By opting for pencil, I intentionally surrendered color, mirroring the way my world lost its vibrancy when art was no longer my primary means of self-expression. The resulting monochromatic palette is a symbol of the emotional numbness that ensued, as if the very hues of my life had faded away leaving only shades of grey.

The texture of my artwork is defined by raw, unsettling marks, mirroring the chaotic emotions that drove me to create a more haunted and tumultuous imagery from the original source material. 

The faded, absent figures and silhouettes embody my disconnection from my artistic self, a manifestation of the longing to regain a sense of purpose and unity, and to fill the void that has taken hold. This is a visual representation of my intense desire to heal, reintegrate, and rediscover my love for art and myself again.
