    <p>
      "Losing" is a four-piece collection that delves into the darker corners of
      my emotional landscape. The deliberate choice of graphite as a medium
      signifies my eluctance to abandon my perfectionistic tendencies, a trait
      that surfaces in my inclination towards realism when drawing â€“ a style
      that demands precision and control.

      By opting for pencil, I intentionally surrendered color, mirroring the way
      my world lost its vibrancy when art was no longer my primary means of
      self-expression. The resulting monochromatic palette is a symbol of the
      emotional numbness that ensued, as if the very hues of my life had faded
      away leaving only shades of grey.

      The texture of my artwork is defined by raw, unsettling marks, mirroring
      the chaotic emotions that drove me to create a more haunted and tumultuous
      imagery from the original source material.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faded, absent figures and silhouettes embody my disconnection from my
      artistic self, a manifestation of the longing to regain a sense of purpose
      and unity, and to fill the void that has taken hold. This is a visual
      representation of my intense desire to heal, reintegrate, and rediscover
      my love for art and myself again.
